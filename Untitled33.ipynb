If you are *currently* pursuing your B.Tech and are expected to graduate in 2027, it should be listed as \"2023 - Present (Expected Graduation: 2027)\" or \"Expected Graduation: 2027\". As it stands, it looks like you are enrolling *this year* for a 3-year B.Tech, which is uncommon in India for AI&ML. Please clarify this.\n",

            "4.  **NPTEL Courses (Add Impact):**\n",

            "5.  **\"About Me\" Focus (Minor):**\n",
            "    *   The sentence \"Aspiring Web Developer and AIML Engineering student...\" is good, but consider the primary role you're applying for. If it's more AI/ML focused, you might rephrase to put AI/ML first, and vice-versa. Or ensure your target role uses both skills.\n",

            "6.  **Projects (Optional Enhancement):**\n",

            "7.  **Contact Info (Minor Refinement):**\n",
